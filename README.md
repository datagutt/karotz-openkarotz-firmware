# karotz-openkarotz-firmware

## What is this all about ?

This repo is an up to date image of openkarotz firmware. Tag V 1.0 is official firmware from Violet. This is a FORK of official project by Massilia, not the original one.

## How does it work ?

This is just the source of openkarotz firmware (modified from Violet ROM), and based on official rom available on Violet server under `rootfs-12.07.19.00.tar.gz` file name.

## How to use ?

These sources have to be re-packaged in a ROMFS format image, then reinstalled.
